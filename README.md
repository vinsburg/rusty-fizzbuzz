Inspired by [Dave Farley's TDD tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfP_v6qCdcs).

Problem taken from [cyber-dojo.org](http://cyber-dojo.org)'s "Fizz Buzz" "kata".


## Problem definition
```
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
